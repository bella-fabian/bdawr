# My Expectations for this Class  
I expect to gain a basic understanding of how to use R and build up on that with data analysis. I also expect to learn a lot about Big Data Analysis and gain an understanding of current research and after this course, I will hopefully be able to understand papers on Big Data Analysis on a methodological level.  
  
**To summarize:** 
  
*   basic understanding of R  
*   performing data analysis in R  
*   gain a methodological understanding of Big Data Analysis
